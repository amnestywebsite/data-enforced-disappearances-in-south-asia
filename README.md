# Data Enforced Disappearances in South Asia
This data was published on 20th March 2024 as a part of Amnesty Internationalâ€™s piece of work on mapping Enforced Disappearances across the region of South Asia. 

## Data collection methodology:

Amnesty International worked with partners and consultants across the countries of Nepal, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Maldives, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, unearthing details of the forcibly disappeared and verifying it. This data is represented decade wise and the decade when the issue of enforced disappearances was most prominent has been picked to represent the depth of the issue. Verification was done through interactions with family members, sourcing media news and interviewing witnesses.
