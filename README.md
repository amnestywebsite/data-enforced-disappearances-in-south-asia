# Data Enforced Disappearances in South Asia
This data was published on 20th March 2024 as a part of Amnesty International’s piece of work on mapping Enforced Disappearances across the region of South Asia. 

## Methodology:
Amnesty International collaborated with more than 20 human rights organizations in South Asia. The details featured on this page are based on the information provided by our partner organizations. The information has been verified in accordance with Amnesty International’s guidelines and used with the informed consent of the families of the forcibly disappeared. In countries such as Afghanistan and India where state reprisals are severe and contacting families of the disappeared would put the families at greater risk, we have collected stories of the forcibly disappeared published in prominent media outlets. To safeguard the individuals and groups involved, meticulous care has been taken to anonymize sensitive information, ensuring that the identities of affected families remain confidential as and when necessary. 

Acknowledging the pervasiveness of enforced disappearances in the region, Amnesty International decided to focus just on one or two decades per country, except for Afghanistan, where outreach efforts have been impeded due to high security risks and the details were collected without limiting to a decade. It is important to mention that the collection of verified stories does not reflect the total number of the disappeared even within the selected decades.

The countries examined include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 
We haven't done and as far as I know, we are not going to do a review of patterns and practices or an historical analysis. Please rephrase or delete.
